-- TASK 1: NON-CORRELATED SUBQUERY
-- Objective: Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0
-- ============================================

-- Business Question: "Which properties are performing better than our quality benchmark of 4.0 stars?"
-- Why Non-Correlated? The 4.0 threshold is fixed - we don't need to recalculate for each property

-- Method 1: Using IN with subquery (Most Common Approach)

-- UNDERSTANDING QUERY EXECUTION
-- ============================================

-- Let's analyze how these subqueries execute

-- Query 1: Simple Non-Correlated Subquery Breakdown
-- Step 1: Inner subquery runs once
SELECT property_id, AVG(rating) 
FROM Review 
GROUP BY property_id 
HAVING AVG(rating) > 4.0;

-- Step 2: Outer query uses those results
SELECT p.name 
FROM Property p 
WHERE p.property_id IN ('result_from_step_1');

-- Query 2: Correlated Subquery Breakdown  
-- For EACH user in the outer query:
-- Step 1: Count bookings for user_id = 'current_user_id'
-- Step 2: Compare count to 3
-- Step 3: Include user if count > 3
-- Repeat for every user
